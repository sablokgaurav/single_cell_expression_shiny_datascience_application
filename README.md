# expression_datascience_visual
a combined expression and datascience approach to look at the expression plots plus the sequence intervals using shiny. I havent added much of the templating but the information you can plot from the same. You can use this for the expression datasets coming from the rna-seq, metagenome expression, bacterial expression and others You can plot also your expression with any other variables such as bins and method variables. This package is still in development.
